The University admitted it’s first students in 1977, and currently boasts about 40,000 students spread across 23 Schools, 3 Colleges, 4 Institutes, and 7 specialized centres of which over 5,000 students are studying at postgraduate level. \nWe are based in the downtown of Juba, the beautiful and cosmopolitan capital of South Sudan.\n\nThe University of Juba (UoJ) was founded in 1975 with the goal of training civil servants for autonomous government of Southern Sudan.\n\nUniversity of Juba (Arabic: جامعة جوبا‎) is a Public University located in Juba, South Sudan, founded in 1975 in response to the need for Higher Education in Southern areas of Sudan. Due to the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983 – 2005), the university relocated to Khartoum, for safety of staff, students and infrastructure\nIn 2006, the government at that time agreed to change the name of the University to Juba National University. Following the attainment of independence by South Sudan in July 2011, the University has relocated back to Juba, where it was founded. The University gives instruction in the English language.\n\nBackground to the University of Juba.\nUniversity of Juba (UJ) was founded in 1975 and envisioned to be the leading Centre of excellence of higher education in the region and the world. The University is dedicated to provide a robust training and human resource capacity building for the developmental needs of the then Southern Sudan. The University has set its goal to conduct training, research and community outreach programmes for sustained peace, eradicating poverty, and enhancing socio-economic growth in South Sudan. Moreover, the core values and the guiding principles of the University are anchored on encouragement and cherishing free and independent thought; a celebration of scholarship, excellence, creativity, and initiative; working as a team; maintenance of an inclusive, safe and clean working environment for students and staff; providing equal opportunity to all; and autonomy of the University.    In October 1977, the University launched undergraduate studies and classes began in four Colleges of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies, Education, Social and Economic Studies, and Adult Education. In 1978 College of Medicine was established to provide medical care and health services to the entire citizens of the country. \n\nIn 1989 the University was relocated to Khartoum due to the devastating civil unrest in Southern Sudan. While in exile the University witnessed enormous expansions on academic and research aspects.\n\nFollowing the independence of South Sudan on 9th July 2011, the University completely repatriated to Juba. Currently the University hosts 13 schools, 4 Centres, 3 institutes and 2 colleges.
